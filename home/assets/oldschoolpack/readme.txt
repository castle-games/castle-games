Thanks for purchasing my Old School Modern graphics pack.

The graphics in this pack were originally released in two separate RPG Maker DLC packs, as well as some free releases along the way. I've compiled all of these assets here into a single pack for this release. This "full version" of the Old School Modern pack is NOT restricted to use in RPG Maker.

I've included two versions of the pack: the actual 100% sized graphics as well as a 200% upscaled version.

The graphics are arranged to work with RPG Maker: the tiles are arranged in a 16x16 (or 32x32 upscaled) grid. Most other tile editor programs should have no problem reading the tiles in this format. Let me know if you have any problems.

If you are using RPG Maker, use the upscaled version of the graphics. If not, I'd suggest using the actual-sized tiles and scaling in your engine for best consistency.

Enjoy.
