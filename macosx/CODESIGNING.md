# Castle macOS Codesigning

## Overview

We use Apple's `Developer ID` program to distribute our macOS binary without using the mac app store. This means that Apple has verified our identity as a corporation and we paid them 99 bucks.

**Desired behavior:** When people open `Castle.app` for the first time, they should see a message like `"Castle.app" is an application downloaded from the internet. Are you sure you want to open it?` along with an `Open` button. This means the app was signed successfully, Apple recognizes who we are, and is allowing the user to open the app.

**Bad behavior:** If codesigning failed for any reason, first-time users of Castle will see some other message like `"Castle.app" can't be opened because it was created by an unidentified developer.` and there will be no `Open` button. Users will need to right-click the app and open it that way. There are also some other errors that can appear here. In general, anything without an `Open` button is bad.

## How we codesign in CI

- We got a Developer ID certificate from Apple. These take several years to expire, so this is just a file that won't change for awhile.
- Our release script runs [codesign-archive.sh](tools/codesign-archive.sh) on the macOS archive it created.
- This script clones a private repo containing a copy of our Developer ID certificate, adds our cert to a temporary keychain on the machine, then codesigns the archive with that certificate.
- Finally, the release script runs [verify-gatekeeper.sh](tools/verify-gatekeeper.sh) to check that the app was actually codesigned correctly. The checks we run are derived from Apple's [Gatekeeper Conformance doc](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Procedures/Procedures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005929-CH4-TNTAG211). If any of the checks fails, the app will not be released.

## Do we codesign locally?

No. Since this is a macOS app, developers building Castle from source can run Castle on their machines without any codesigning. So most people on the team never need to get a copy of our certificate or run any of the codesigning scripts.

## Caveats

Right now our app does not conform to Apple's newer concepts of "runtime hardening" or "notarization". These are basically the closest Apple can get to App Review without making us use the app store. Notarization will be required starting in macOS Catalina, so at some point we'll need to figure that out.

## Why not use fastlane?

At some point it will probably make sense to switch over to using fastlane for this. However, at the time of writing, fastlane didn't make sense because:

- It didn't have support for these oddball `Developer ID` certs, which only apply to people distributing mac apps outside the mac app store.
- `fastlane match` is good for sharing certs among many people when the cert is changing often. This is often true for iOS projects. In our case, the cert "never" changes (once every several years) and the only entity that needs the cert is CI. So the utility of integrating `fastlane match` was low.

If fastlane adds first class support for our usecase then I imagine we'll switch over.

## How to debug codesigning issues

### Clear any existing gatekeeper state on your local machine

If you previously override Gatekeeper's rules for any instance of Castle, you'll want to clear out those exceptions so that your machine acts like it's never seen Castle before:

```
sudo spctl --list | grep Castle
```

If the output of that command was empty, you're good to go. If any "rules" appeared here with unique numbers, remove them:

```
spctl --remove --rule <rule number>
```

### Verify the app locally

You can run [verify-gatekeeper.sh](tools/verify-gatekeeper.sh) locally on any `.app`. You can also run individual commands from that script to see more verbose output.

Team members can also run our codesigning script locally. Clone our private certificate repository, then provide the path to the certificate as an argument to the codesigning script. You do not need to manually add the cert to your keychain.

```
./tools/codesign-archive.sh some-archive.xcarchive ../path/to/macos/CastleDeveloperID.p12
```

Where `some-archive.xcarchive` was created with `xcodebuild` or by our release script.

### Possible issues

- Anything about "already signed" or "unsealed" is likely to be an issue with one of Castle's supporting Frameworks. We have several (SDL, Love, Lua, etc.). As of macOS Mavericks, Frameworks needs to conform to a really specific file format. You can run [update-framework.sh](tools/update-framework.sh) on an older framework to convert it to a valid format.
- Anything about "identity could not be verified" means some other aspect of Gatekeeper failed that we weren't able to check automatically. One example is that the app cannot reference any `@rpath` outside of the app's bundle ([docs](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Procedures/Procedures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005929-CH4-TNTAG211)). To inspect this, open `Console.app`, then read the logs while trying to open `Castle.app` and look for errors about `failed on rPathCmd`.
- If you see "Apple cannot check it for malicious software", you're on a new version of macOS (10.14.5 or newer) that requires Notarization. See previous mention of notarization.
